# Talking Trivia Alarm Clock

The code in this folder shows you how to build a talking trivia alarm clock,
that wakes you up with trivia questions:

"Wake up! Wake up! It's time to play trivia! What's 9 x 100?"

It was designed to run on the [AIY Voice Kit](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/).
