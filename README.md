# Talking to Machines

Welcome to the Talking to Machines repo, full of all the code you need
to build smart, AIY-powered machines that are smart enough to talk back.

You'll find code divided into a couple of different folders.

- The aiy folder contains useful tools for interacting with the [AIY kits](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/).
- The talking_diary is project code for building a talking diary on the Google Assistant.
- The trivia_alarm is project code for building a trivia alarm on an AIY kit.
- js_utils are various Javascript libraries (like streaming to Dialogflow) that are used throughout projects.

Blog posts coming soon... stay tuned!
